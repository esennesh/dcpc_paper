# Divide-and-Conquer Predictive Coding: a structured Bayesian inference algorithm

This repository is the official implementation of [Divide-and-Conquer Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05834).

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train any experiment in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py -c experiments/<experiment_name>_config.json
```

As an example, you can train the Deep Latent Gaussian Model on MNIST via
```train_mnist
python train.py -c experiments/dcpc_mnist_config.json
```
and then watch training progress on Tensorboard via
```tensorboard_mnist
tensorboard --logdir saved/log/Mnist_Dcpc/<date_and_time>
```
The JSON configuration files contain all necessary hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate any experiment in the paper, open:
```eval_jupyter
experiments/<experiment_name>_eval.ipynb
```
in Jupyter Lab, making sure to set `experiments/` as your current directory. You
can also run an evaluation notebook from the command line:
```eval_nbconvert
cd dcpc_paper/experiments;
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace <experiment_name>_eval.ipynb
```

The following specific notebooks, once equipped with the pre-trained weights and
particles documented below, will reproduce the figures in the paper:

  * Figure 3a comes from `experiments/dcpc_mnist_eval.ipynb` as `dcpc_mnist_recons.pdf`;
  * Figure 3b comes from `experiments/dcpc_emnist_eval.ipynb` as `dcpc_emnist_recons.pdf`;
  * Figure 3c comes from `experiments/dcpc_fashionmnist_eval.ipynb` as `dcpc_fashionmnist_recons.pdf`;
  * Figure 4a comes from `experiments/dcpc_celeba_eval.ipynb` as `dcpc_celeba_recons.pdf`; and
  * Figure 4b comes from `experiments/dcpc_celeba_eval.ipynb` as `dcpc_celeba_predictive.pdf`.

- Weights and particles for the [Deep Latent Gaussian Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GV5a8evIIJmV5816zQRHwTSl2vmx91zR/view?usp=share_link) (Figure 3b) trained on Extended MNIST;
- Weights and particles for the [Deep Latent Gaussian Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n2-TzTmOMH8dbnYnkI_SM2i5aubqmmk/view?usp=share_link) (Figure 3c) trained on Fashion MNIST; and
- Weights and particles for the [Convolutional Generator network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11mFxrefTcE0k9hIyyu5r2Mg1HVvZzRei/view?usp=share_link) (Figure 4) trained on CelebA.

## Results

Quantitatively, we evaluated DCPC as a Bayesian inference algorithm in generative
modeling, via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score on CelebA. We
achieve the following results in comparison to other inference algorithms,
holding the model architectures constant:

### Training time and Frechet Inception Distances
| Inference algorithm        | Likelihood          | Resolution | Sweeps x Epochs | FID  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---- |
| Particle Gradient Descent  | Normal              |   32 x 32  |      1 x 100    | 100  |
| **DCPC (ours)**            | Normal              |   32 x 32  |      1 x 100    | **82.7** |
| Langevin Predictive Coding | Discretized Normal  |   64 x 64  |    300 x 15     | 120  |
| Variational Autoencoder    | Discretized Normal  |   64 x 64  |      1 x 4500   | 86.3 |
| **DCPC (ours)**            | Discretized Normal  |   64 x 64  |     30 x 150    | **79.0** |

For those wondering what a "discretized Normal" distribution is, we provide an
implementation as a Pyro distribution, in `utils.util.DiscretizedGaussian`. The
definition comes from the literature on diffusion models.
